      <p>
        We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially when conducting business. This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use of the various services offered by Zariin.com (collectively, "Services") ("Authorised Customers").

      <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
      <p>
        Refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (that is, without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.
      </p>
      <h3>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?</h3>
      <p>
        We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect the following additional information from our Authorised Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of Authorised Customers, the nature and size of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory that the Authorised Customer intends to purchase or sell.
      </p>
      <h3>What organisations are collecting the information?</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorised Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information provided to them from Visitors and Authorised Customers. Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</h3>
      <p>
        We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorised Customers about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorised Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested information.

      <h3>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</h3>
      <p>
        Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorised Customers.

      <h3>How does LUME use login information?</h3>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law</h3>
      <p>
        We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to comply with a court order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement agency to release information. We will also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of our Visitors and Authorised Customers.

      <h3>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable Information?</h3>
      <p>
        Visitors and Authorised Customers may contact us to update Personally Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by emailing us at <a href="mailto:lume.elegence@gmail.com" style="color: #3a2414; text-decoration: underline;">lume.elegence@gmail.com</a>.

      <h3>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Site?</h3>
      <p>
        We provide Visitors and Authorised Customers with a mechanism to delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database by contacting <a href="mailto:lume.elegence@gmail.com" style="color: #3a2414; text-decoration: underline;">lume.elegence@gmail.com</a>. However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining some residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>What happens if the Privacy Policy changes?</h3>
      <p>
        We will let our Visitors and Authorised Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorised Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Visitor or Authorised Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorised Customer to prevent such disclosure.
